BannerUI is a new, modern admin panel for Roblox games. BannerUI is designed to be simple and elegant, allowing you to quickly perform actions on any player in Roblox.

BannerUI features many features to help you moderate your game. These include:

- Warn a player for any reason
- Kick any player in your server
- Ban any user from the game or a specific server
- Send a message to everybody in your server
- View history of actions you've performed
- Easily add players as administrators
- Install and update in seconds with the plugin

Additionally, many features are **planned to be added**, such as:

- More detailed history
- Additional settings, maybe custom themes.
- Ability to use BannerUI as a ModuleScript without the UI.
- Menu to teleport player's characters or servers
- Spectate a player
- Chat logs for a player
- Expand warnings and server messages to other servers

You can install and update BannerUI in two ways:

- Install and auto-update via [BannerUI Manager](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15113016858/BannerUI%3Fkeyword=&pageNumber=&pagePosition=)
- Manually install and update through the [stable release](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15118309100/BannerUI%3Fkeyword=&pageNumber=&pagePosition=) or [dev release](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/15111210426/BannerDev%3Fkeyword=&pageNumber=&pagePosition=)

![setup|690x172](upload://lyIuuetHbU4Cjvkgu7WZHY2wTbb.png)

1. To set up BannerUI, ensure the <kbd>BannerManager </kbd> script is located in <kbd>ServerScriptService</kbd>.
2. The auto-installer automatically inserts the script to <kbd>ServerScriptService</kbd>.
3. Once the script is in the right spot, locate the <kbd>Authorized</kbd> folder. It can be found under the main script.
4. To add an administrator, create any object (or duplicate/modify the existing object) in the <kbd>Authorized</kbd> folder. 
5. Set the name of your new object to the User ID of the player you want to be an Admin. The other properties of the object do not matter.
6. Repeat this process for all admins, and BannerUI will do the rest.
